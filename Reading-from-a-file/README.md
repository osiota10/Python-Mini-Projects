# Python File System



The file contains information about ACT Co. (Alliance Computer & Mobile.
Technology) which is shared with investors and the press. The company may update this text file
annually. For both parts below, your solution should still work if small changes are made to the
files in the future, such as if the company description were expanded, sales numbers changed,
product names changes, added or removed. You may assume that all products will either be listed
as `million sold` or `thousand sold`.

## Task
(a) Write code to read the text file and print out the `5 top-selling notable products`, in
`descending order of sales`. Number the items but do not include the sales figures. The
expected output for the given file should look as follows:
1. Phone
2. Tablet
3. RGB Coffee Mug
4. Keyboard
5. PC

(b) In another cell, write code which will prompt the user for an integer from 1 to 5 (referring
to one of the 5 top-selling notable products in order from most sold to least). Your program
should print out the name of the product and sales as a full sentence, for example:
`ACT Phone has sold 82.1 million units`.
You do not need to validate user input for this question. You may assume that the user has
input an integer between 1 and 5. Remember that data in variables defined in part (a) may
still be used in cell(s) for part (b) so you do not need to read the file a second time.
